            Welcome to  Kingdom of Lordran! Here, you can enjoy a variety of activities,
            such as dodging giant arrows and meeting some of our most renowned
            residents. In  Kingdom of Lordran, there are no bad days; we have sunshine
            24/7â€”unless our Daughter of Light happens to perish, but that is
            highly unlikely to occur anytime soon.
